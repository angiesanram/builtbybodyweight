              <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant. The Coffea plant is native to subtropical Africa and some islands in southern Asia. The plant was exported from Africa to countries around the world and coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are the highly regarded arabica, and the less sophisticated but stronger and more hardy robusta. Once ripe, coffee beans are picked, processed, and dried. Green (unroasted) coffee beans are one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world. Once traded, the coffee beans are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and brewed to produce coffee as a beverage.</p>

        <strong>BuiltByBodyweight</strong> was created with the aim of inspiring others
        to transform their bodies using just their own bodyweight as resistance, also known
        as calisthenics. Calisthenics is a fast growing area of fitness and that is for good reason,
         it is extremely effective at transforming your fitness.
         <br/>
         Gyms have become synonymous with fitness but I and countless others are proof that
         a gym membership is not necessary to get into excellent shape.
