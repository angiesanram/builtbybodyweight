Brief overview of building muscle using bodyweight exercises.

We live in an information age where there is an abundance of information at our fingertips, this can have both a negative and positive effect. Because of this connectivity and relentless bombardment of information, today, more than ever, there is pressure on people to be fit and look good and there is a wealth of information to go along with it. Unfortunately, not all information is created equal.

When it comes to building muscle a lot of information is generated by organisation's trying to make money and as a result there is a huge conflict of interest in this particular area. This conflict of interest, I believe, results in a lot of misinformation.

The general public have been conditioned to believe that the only way to build muscle is by signing a contract at a gym and using their ‘special’ exercise machines to pack on the muscle. This could not be further from the truth. Admittedly, if you want to become the next Mr Universe then you will require a gym but you will also require a whole lot of steroids which is another story. For the average male or female that wants to build an aesthetic physique with a respectable amount of muscle, special gym equipment is not required. All that is required is your own body.

Just take a moment to appreciate the muscular development of the individuals depicted in the following photos. These individuals have not used expensive gym equipment, their physiques are purely a result of the training or activities they perform.

This man is a sand digger in Africa, his physique is the result of endless hours of lifting sand from the bottom of the river into a boat.

How is it that these people were able to build such a physique without the use of a gym?

'RESISTANCE IS RESISTANCE'

The answer to this is simple, the body and the mind do not discriminate between a barbell, a bucket of sand or bodyweight. Resistance is resistance.

In order to build muscle the muscles must be provided with a stimulus to grow and over time this stimulus must increase to account for the growth in size and strength of the muscle. Consistent stimuli and overload is what is going to help you build muscle. Now, in a gym this progression is very easy as you can just add more weight to the bar. To build muscle with bodyweight exercises you have to be a little more creative.

Progressive overload using bodyweight exercises can be done by increasing reps and performing a more difficult variation of an exercise. Once your are able to perform a certain number of reps on a given exercise it may no longer be beneficial to keep increasing the reps and therefore a more difficult variation is required.

A more difficult exercise variation will either change the angle to increase the percentage of your bodyweight acting against the muscle or it will change the lever to increase the amount of tension being placed on the muscle.
